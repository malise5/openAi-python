# Flask Chat Application with OpenAI Integration

This is a simple Flask chat application that integrates with OpenAI's GPT models. Users can interact with a chatbot powered by OpenAI to generate responses based on their input.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the Flask application:

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.x
-   pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd your-repo
    ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

    - On Linux or macOS:

        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

    - On Windows:

        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

5. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Configuration

1. Set your OpenAI API key:

    Replace `'your-API-key'` in `app.py` with your actual OpenAI API key.

    ```python
    # Set your OpenAI API key
    openai.api_key = 'your-api-key'
    ```

2. Set Flask secret key:

    Replace the `app.secret_key` value with a secret key for session management.

    ```python
    app.secret_key = 'your-secret-key'
    ```

### Usage

1. Run the Flask application:

    ```bash
    flask run
    ```

    The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` or another address specified in the terminal.

2. Open a web browser and go to the specified address.

3. Interact with the chatbot by entering messages in the chat input.

## Testing with Postman

You can test the `/chat` endpoint using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/). Use the following details:

-   URL: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/chat` (or your specified address)
-   Method: POST
-   Body: Set `user_input` as a form parameter with the desired input.

## OpenAI Playground

Explore and experiment with OpenAI's GPT models using the [OpenAI Playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground). This interactive environment allows you to input prompts and see model-generated outputs in real-time.
